# Martin He√ümann

Hey there, I'm Martin. Trying to catch myself in words feels a bit like photographing a moving bicycle - there's always some blur around the edges, you know? That's kind of how I experience life and work - in constant motion, with thoughts flowing and shifting as they go.

## About Me

Born in 1989 in [Neuruppin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuruppin), I now find myself navigating the streets of [Berlin Friedrichshain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain). I studied Communication Design at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) from 2010 to 2014, finishing my Bachelor with a 1.7 grade and a thesis on Natural User Interfaces that somehow naturally pointed me toward where I am now.

## How My Mind Works

I'm the type who likes to just start typing or sketching and let thoughts unfold wherever they want to go, a bit like riding my bicycle through Berlin's neighborhoods. You start pedaling in one direction, but the interesting side streets and unexpected views are what make the journey worth it.

This approach shapes how I engage with work:
- Leading teams as Digital Product Manager at [AN¬Æ](https://an.design)
- Finding that sweet spot where design meets technology
- Flowing with small teams where ideas build on each other naturally
- Creating digital tools that actually help humans do things better

I've found that small, peaceful teams create this continuous stream of input and process without feeling like an overwhelming Hinderniss that you can't √ºberwinden. There's a natural rhythm to it - thoughts build, evolve, sometimes circle back, but always keep moving.

## Professional Journey

My path has unfolded somewhat like my bike routes through the city - some planned roads, some wonderful detours:
- Digital Product Manager at [AN¬Æ](https://an.design) (current)
- Digital Art Director at [Unit U+2463 GmbH](https://unit23.com/) (March 2018 - July 2023)
- UX/UI Designer at [Ape Unit GmbH](https://apeunit.com) (July 2014 - March 2018)
- Freelance designer for web, print, and corporate design (various periods)

## On Labels and Expectations

Over time, I've worn different hats that people might use to categorize me:
```
Webdesigner ‚Üí Communication Designer ‚Üí UX/UI Designer ‚Üí Digital Art Director ‚Üí Product Manager
```

And I've learned something interesting - I get a bit worried about being labeled, because labels can create expectations that feel like barriers. Through therapy and some really healing relationships, I've discovered that many of these perceived limitations are actually psychological constructs rather than real issues with me as a designer, developer, project manager, friend, or father.

It's been liberating to realize that the boxes don't have to define the journey. Sometimes what seems like an obstacle is just interesting terrain to navigate.

## Finding My Flow State

What clicks with me about [AN¬Æ](https://an.design) is their feel-good philosophy - this understanding that we're humans first, professionals second. Their hyper-collaborative, open approach just fits how my mind works.

Small, well-coordinated project teams give me that continuous current of ideas without the overwhelming pressure of rigid structures. It's like a good conversation that just builds momentum naturally.

## Projects & Collaborations That Matter

Some work I've been involved with:
- Supporting [Gr√ºn Berlin](https://gruen-berlin.de) and InfraSignal with long-term technical guidance and digital design, helping keep innovation flowing within these established companies
- Co-creating the B2B styleguide for [easyCredit Partner I](https://partner.easycredit.de), where we work closely on their online marketing strategy - it's like co-parenting a digital brand identity
- Helping [Ninetailed.io](https://www.ninetailed.io/) create their custom Tailwind setup, perfectly aligned with their Contentful stack and website needs - a great example of making technical solutions feel natural
- Working with [Tertianum Premium Residences](https://www.tertianum.de/) alongside Amelie Drews, a marketing manager with an amazing digital mindset, and Julian Fleck, whose empathic approach to brand design creates something truly special
- Supporting WoMoFonds [https://womofonds.de/](https://womofonds.de/) and Dein-WoMo [https://dein-womo.de/](https://dein-womo.de/) in making their services more accessible and developing unique identities, a project made even better through collaboration with my brilliant colleague Cornelia Herishek
- Building an interactive 3D strategy game for [E.ON](https://www.eon.com/de/c/whatsnetz.html) that makes energy grids understandable and engaging - a fantastic collaboration between our AN¬Æ design and dev team and Ray Sono's game designers and account managers

What's kind of funny is that I built [ElodieCarstensen.com](https://www.elodiecarstensen.com/) without having created my own website before - just exploring with an AI assistant. That sort of captures how I approach things - just start pedaling and trust that you'll figure out the path as you go.

## Skills That Have Emerged Along The Way

Things I've picked up throughout my journey:
- Product management that focuses on people as much as processes
- [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) and [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) approaches to keep projects flowing
- UX/UI design that centers on actual humans and their needs
- Collaborative teamwork that feels natural, not forced
- Digital art direction that tells meaningful stories
- SEO optimization that helps creators like Marie reach their audience
- Brand design and social media strategy for spaces like Studio Stellar that are creating important inclusive environments

But perhaps the most valuable thing I've learned is that creativity isn't about perfection - it's about movement. The process matters as much as the destination.

## Continuing The Journey

I've come to value the path more than the endpoint. Creating, collaborating, growing - it's all part of this continuous flow, like a bicycle ride that takes unexpected turns but always moves forward. Sometimes challenging, often joyful, always worth the pedaling.
