# Martin He√ümann

Hey there, I'm Martin. Trying to put myself into words always feels a bit like trying to capture something that's in constant motion - the moment you think you've got it, something's already shifted.

## About Me

Born in 1989 in [Neuruppin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuruppin), I now live in [Berlin Friedrichshain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain). I studied Communication Design at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) from 2010 to 2014, completing my Bachelor of Arts with a grade of 1.7. My thesis focused on Natural User Interfaces, which now feels like an early hint towards my eventual path in digital product management.

## How I Work

I'm the kind of person who just starts typing or sketching and sees where it leads me. It's a bit like riding my bicycle - you start pedaling without knowing exactly where you'll end up, but trusting that the journey itself will be worthwhile.

This approach shapes everything I do at work:
- Leading teams as Digital Product Manager at [AN¬Æ](https://an.design)
- Working at the intersection of design and technology
- Collaborating in small teams where ideas flow naturally
- Building digital tools that solve real human problems

I find that small, tight-knit teams create this constant flow of input and process that doesn't feel overwhelming. There's something about that continuous exchange that just feels right to me.

## Professional Journey

My career path has unfolded somewhat organically:
- Digital Product Manager at [AN¬Æ](https://an.design) (current)
- Digital Art Director at [Unit U+2463 GmbH](https://unit23.com/) (March 2018 - July 2023)
- UX/UI Designer at [Ape Unit GmbH](https://apeunit.com) (July 2014 - March 2018)
- Design Intern at [Ape Unit GmbH](https://apeunit.com) (2013)
- Freelance designer for web, print, and corporate design (various periods)

Each role has been less of a calculated career move and more of an exploration into what feels meaningful and engaging.

## On Labels and Expectations

Over time, I've worn many professional hats:
```
Digital Art Director ‚Üí UX/UI Designer ‚Üí Freelancer ‚Üí Product Manager
```

I've sometimes worried about being labeled, because labels can create expectations that feel like Hindernisse - obstacles that seem impossible to overcome. Through therapy and supportive relationships, I've learned that many of these perceived limitations are psychological constructs rather than actual issues with me as a designer, developer, project manager, friend, or father.

## Finding the Right Environment

What I appreciate about [AN¬Æ](https://an.design) is their "feel-good philosophy" - this recognition that we're humans first, professionals second. Their approach is hyper-collaborative, hands-on, with an open file culture that aligns with how I naturally work.

Small, well-coordinated project teams give me that continuous flow of ideas without the overwhelming pressure of rigid structures. It feels natural, like a good conversation that builds momentum on its own.

## Projects That Matter to Me

Some work I've been involved with:
- Developing [Gr√ºn Berlin](https://gruen-berlin.de)'s website for sustainable public spaces
- Leading design for [easyCredit-Ratenkauf](https://www.easycredit-ratenkauf.de/)
- Redesigning [Ninetailed.io](https://www.ninetailed.io/) to showcase personalization capabilities
- Designing for [Tertianum Premium Residences](https://www.tertianum-berlin.de/)
- Collaborating with [Elodie Carstensen](https://www.elodiecarstensen.com/) on fashion projects

Interestingly, I built [ElodieCarstensen.com](https://www.elodiecarstensen.com/) without having created my own website before - just exploring with an AI assistant called [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/). That captures my approach pretty well: just start and see where it takes you.

## Skills and Approaches

Things I've picked up along the way:
- Product management in creative contexts
- [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) and [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) project management
- UX/UI design with human-centered approaches
- Collaborative teamwork
- Digital art direction and visual storytelling

But maybe the most useful skill has been learning to trust the process - understanding that creativity isn't about having all the answers upfront.

## Writing & Thoughts

Over the years, I've written about my experiences and observations. Here are some pieces that capture different moments:

- [Tropical Island: Eine Reise ins K√ºnstliche Paradies](/articles/tropical-island-2012) (2012) - A satirical review of Berlin's infamous indoor tropical resort, originally published in HTW Berlin's design magazine.

## Moving Forward

I've come to value the journey over the destination. Creating, collaborating, growing - it's all part of this continuous flow. Sometimes challenging, often joyful, always worth the ride.
