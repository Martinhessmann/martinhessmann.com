            My journey into the world of design and technology began at HTW Berlin, where I studied Communication Design. I chose this path because I wanted to grow up, be independent, and provide for my family. But what I really enjoyed back then were the bike rides through the city, exploring Berlin's vibrant design scene, and connecting with fellow creatives.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            During my studies, I discovered my passion for digital design and user experience. The intersection of creativity and technology fascinated me, and I found myself drawn to projects that involved creating digital interfaces and experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This period was foundational for me, as I developed not only technical skills but also a design philosophy centered around solving real problems for real people. I learned that good design goes beyond aesthetics‚Äîit's about understanding user needs and creating solutions that are both beautiful and functional.

            My first professional experiences during this time helped me understand the industry and where I wanted to position myself. I was particularly drawn to digital product design, where I could combine my creative skills with a structured approach to problem-solving.

            At Ape Unit GmbH, where I started as an intern in 2013 and later became a UX/UI Designer (2014-2018), I realized I needed more than just visuals‚ÄîI needed structure, principles, and a plan. This was my transition period from graphic design to user experience design.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Working on various digital products, I discovered the power of user-centered design approaches. I learned to conduct user research, create personas, map user journeys, and test prototypes with real users. This methodical approach to design was a revelation to me.

          <p className="mb-4">
            I also began to appreciate the collaborative nature of UX design, working closely with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to create cohesive digital experiences. This interdisciplinary approach became a cornerstone of my professional philosophy.

            I never really understood why we called it "Art Direction," but as our team grew at Unit 4 and we had more than one designer on a project, we could finally split up cognitive and creative work. This period marked my transition into leadership roles in design and product management.

          <p className="mb-4">
            As an Art Director and later as a Product Manager, I was responsible for guiding teams and shaping digital products from concept to launch. I learned to balance creative vision with business objectives, technical constraints, and user needs.

            During this time, I also deepened my understanding of product strategy and how design decisions impact business outcomes. I worked closely with stakeholders to align product development with organizational goals, always advocating for the user's perspective.

            I don't really know where the AI bubble is going, and to be honest, it's kind of crazy to watch fully generative images, videos, marketing funnels, and ads evolve at this speed. Looking ahead to future opportunities and challenges in the ever-evolving digital product landscape is both exciting and daunting.

          <p className="mb-4">
            As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to transform our industry, I'm particularly interested in how these technologies can enhance rather than replace human creativity.
