      fullContent: `
        <p>Berlin's mobility transition requires not only new infrastructure, but also transparency and the active involvement of citizens. How can we get all interest groups on board and make the processes comprehensible?</p>
        <p>Together with Gr√ºn Berlin, we have developed a digital communication platform that visualises progress in real time and offers interactive opportunities for participation.</p>
        <p>The platform creates a space in which citizens can give feedback and actively participate in urban development. Acceptance for sustainable urban projects is promoted through the transparent presentation of all projects and targeted communication with various interest groups.</p>
        <p>With this platform, Gr√ºn Berlin shows how mobility transition and urban development can be shaped together with the population - for a liveable, sustainable city.</p>

      excerpt: 'Developing "What\'s Netz", an interactive energy grid simulation with gamification elements for showrooms and trade fairs.',
      fullContent: `
        <p>The energy transition is more than just the expansion of renewable energies - it means making the energy distribution grids future-proof. This is exactly where What's Netz comes in: a digital grid simulation that explains complex grid structures in a fun and understandable way.</p>
        <p>Developed in collaboration with E.ON and RaySono, What's Netz offers interactive 3D graphics, intuitive navigation and gamification elements that make energy grids and their significance tangible.</p>
        <p>The application is aimed at decision-makers from politics and the media, provides schools with a valuable learning tool and inspires at trade fairs and in showrooms. It makes the big picture visible - how grids work, what measures are necessary and how municipalities of all sizes can actively shape the energy transition.</p>
        <p>Our focus was on creating an experience that not only informs, but also inspires. Based on Ray Sono's vision, we developed the UI and UX design from scratch and implemented it technically with React Three Fibre.</p>
        <p>What's Netz is an example of how digital transformation not only imparts knowledge, but also inspires people to take action - for a sustainable and better connected future.</p>
