## Getting Started (2010-2014) 🎨

I studied Communication Design at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) because I wanted to grow up, be independent, and provide for my family. But what I really enjoyed back then were the bike rides through the city 🚲 connecting dots that wouldn't exist if I had just taken the U-Bahn or a cab (not that I could afford one).

Freelancing during this time was less about building a career and more about trying things out—having my first direct client interactions, helping them reach their goals with the tools I had at hand, and learning the rest on the go.

## From Design to UX (2013-2018) 🎯

At [Ape Unit GmbH](https://apeunit.com), where I started as an intern in 2013 and later became a UX/UI Designer (2014-2018), I realized I needed more than just visuals—I needed structure, principles, a plan. Otherwise, projects quickly turned into a mess of taste, opinions, and impulses. That chaos drained my motivation and confused the developers at Ape Unit (shoutout to Emil, Micha, and Max ♥).

I started seeing how a simple bullet point list of features or a structured, almost text-adventure-like user story format helped create a shared language. It gave us a way to talk things through with both the team and the client, to align on what we actually wanted and needed. "I want that, I don't like that, I feel like something is missing…"

## "Art" Direction (2018-2023) 🎨

I never really understood why we called it that, but as our team grew at Unit 4 and we had more than one designer on a project (shoutout to Ray), we could finally split up cognitive and creative work. And while I loved the visuals, I found myself more and more drawn to development flows, handovers, processes, and data.

## "AN"kommen (2023-Present) 🚀

Now, at [AN](https://an.jetzt), I feel like I've reached a point where I'm happy with my role. I have the freedom to decide how we advise clients, what solutions we propose, how we structure teams, which experts we bring in, and how we manage timelines, budgets, and processes. I also focus on what the team needs to work well—communication, time management, workflow clarity.

And then COVID happened 😷 Our semi-remote team had to go fully remote, which gave us both freedom and the need for daily check-ins—via Slack, Notion, Toggl. It shaped how we work together now.

## Side Projects 🌱

These aren't really side projects—they're more like things I pass on. Community work. Sharing experiences, making connections, valuing the things I do or did—not just for money, but for what they create in the long run.

## What's Next? 🤔

I don't really know where the AI bubble is going, and to be honest, it's kind of crazy to watch fully generative images, videos, marketing funnels, and ads evolve at this speed.

I help my colleagues at [Openwonder.com](https://openwonder.com) navigate that space, but I'm also critical of the ethics and impact this has in the hyper-capitalist phase we're in. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement and forget that all of this is only possible because of billion-dollar investments from big tech companies. We're privileged to have access to these tools, and we shouldn't take that for granted.
