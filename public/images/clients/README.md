# Client Website Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of client websites for the Safari-style suggestions component.

## How to generate the screenshots

1. Make sure you have Puppeteer installed as a dev dependency:
   ```
   npm install puppeteer --save-dev
   ```

2. Run the website screenshot script:
   ```
   npm run fetch-previews
   ```

This will automatically capture screenshots of all websites listed in the `scripts/fetch-website-previews.js` file and save them to this directory with the proper naming convention.

## Manual Alternative

If the automated script doesn't work for some websites (due to CORS or other restrictions), you can manually:

1. Visit each website
2. Take a screenshot (preferably at 1200x800 resolution)
3. Save the file with the website domain as the filename (e.g., `example.com.jpg`)
4. Place all screenshots in this directory

## Website List

The complete list of websites to capture can be found in `scripts/fetch-website-previews.js`. The image paths in the `SafariSuggestions` component should match the filenames generated by the script.
