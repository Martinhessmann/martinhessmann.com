That sounds amazing. My biggest question is how I can turn my agency experience into something that fits another digital agency, a corporate role, a startup, or another setup. I have worked in a digital agency for over ten years and held leadership roles in account management, design management, and dev ops. I often operate like a one-person agency for a few clients at the same time. I am also wondering if it is possible to avoid a traditional resume that only lists an eleven-year agency role. I would like a portfolio that is not just pretty UI, but something that shows the role I had in agency projects as real job references and experience. This is something I need help with.

Money is the thing pulling me right now. It sounds sad, and it is not how I operate, but it is how my boss evaluates my work. What drives me is connecting with clients and project managers one-on-one. I want to understand how they operate their businesses, what their goals are, who their clients are, and what stakeholders they have to please. I want to understand their design system and dig in deeply. I like to ask if the design is good, if their Azure cloud WordPress setup is the right choice, and if their AI expert is truly an expert. I am really happy when I can draft quick improvements and alternatives. I am working for TeamBank, a big bank from Nurnberg, and I could say more about the clients, but as a summary, the things that drive me are cases where a design system exists but feels like a burden. I can dig in quickly, make it fun, and achieve results. Sadly, that is not valued in my agency, which mostly values billable days. I am seeking something else.

I cannot fully answer that because I have never been in a different role. But I am driven by commitment and stability where I can spend a whole day or week on one problem. I do not want to change topics every day or work only until the next quarter, then lose control as someone else takes over. I am interested in long-term strategies. I would not miss switching between open projects. I have worked in different fields and know what works well for me. I am looking forward to settling into that area or combination of areas.

After three or four meetings in a day, I am drained and not looking forward to the same schedule the next day. I need more time working on something than sitting in meetings. I like collaborative processes like workshops, scribbling together, wireframing, cutting things apart, and putting them back together. I like sitting with a developer or a junior designer and focusing on one thing for an hour or two. I also love quiet time where I can be alone with the problem. I like asking how to use two hours best, whether by using AI, scribbling, coding, or doing research. I love having almost a whole day to tinker and feel my way through something.

In loud discussions, especially with a lot of men, I am not the loudest person in the room. Loud voices often force quick decisions that are not wise or grounded in expertise. If things are clear, decisions are easy. Loud discussions often mean someone is stressed or afraid. I prefer taking things apart and talking one-on-one to understand why someone is upset. Then I can respond calmly with a suggestion. That often leads to better solutions than shouting at a group.

I do not like the ecommerce world, and I am not experienced enough in analytics, traffic, big data, or ecommerce. I work more on B2B platforms, intranets, and brand processes. I look at page speed and SEO, and I know best practices. But I am not the person setting ad budgets or marketing strategies. If a site does not hit the mark in terms of sales, that is usually not my scope.

In leadership, what works best for me is making sure people are aware of scope and responsibilities before they start. I want them hooked on the client, doing research, and meeting users or stakeholders so they find their own motivation. If I am not happy with results, I can take over and be direct about expectations or ask them to reallocate resources. Sometimes I sit next to them and body-double to support them. I also ask them to present their work, because presentation prep often reveals gaps. I ask for prototypes, which quickly show what is not working. For developers, I ask them to test with real data and real content. I want juniors to think into the next iteration and prepare work for client review, test audiences, or even production for A/B testing.

I imagine leadership as bringing people together around a challenge they did not think they could solve. It is like a sports event where they reach a goal they did not think possible. Doing something as a team is beautiful. I cannot define success alone. I do not like karaoke, and my old band never made me happy, but now I am in a choir with forty or fifty people. My voice is one of many, and I want to be on time and on tune. If I miss a note, it is okay, but I keep going because they need me and I need them. We create something bigger and more beautiful. That is what I want in work too: to be part of something bigger, needed at each step, and to do something I could not do without the team.

I wish for a place where people are not working only to satisfy investors or get the next funding round. I want to work on real-world issues like climate, housing, inequality, transportation, or infrastructure. I want to support companies that solve real human needs. In my agency work, we sometimes create new problems or pretend to know how to make people want more. We convince ourselves and our bosses, and it becomes a charade. It has to look good so we can sell it or raise stock prices. That bothers me. I understand that many companies depend on funding, but I do not want to sell something that does not exist or that lacks real value to me.

That kind of work would feel beautiful and valuable to me, and I would be willing to travel for it. If Berlin does not have those jobs because of bureaucracy or a finance-only market, I would move to Copenhagen, Zurich, or even Shanghai. I would go where companies have the resources and philosophy to solve real-world issues, whether with big data, large language models, cloud-based infrastructure, or better prototypes and services. I want to build things people can use, understand why they do not work, and improve them with feedback. That is the world I am looking for.

I have lived in Berlin for eighteen years and came here at eighteen. I want a change. I stayed because I have a kid who is now seventeen and can stand on their own. I do not need to be in a caretaker role anymore, and I can start a new phase of life. I want to be a role model as my kid starts their own career. If they can take that step, so can I.

The topic that interests me most is transportation and infrastructure: trains, electric cars, planes, bicycles, and the data around them. The second biggest topic is farming and food production. I am a vegetarian who eats fish, and I do not like meat products anymore. It makes me sick that people still profit from that. I like to cook, and I think the climate crisis is real. It upsets me that most of us cannot put time and effort into changing it.

If this is too narrow, we could widen it to arts, movies, health, music instruments, news, politics, or education. I am generally open, but if two topics are enough, that is fine with me.

Now that the question is framed like this, I am rolling back on movies, arts, and music. In recent years I worked closely with dancers, musicians, fashion designers, and filmmakers because they are my friends. It makes me happy to see something beautiful happen in real time, like an immersive event with music, light, performance, movement, and fashion. But I do not feel I belong in that realm. My strengths do not connect those dots, so it may not be my next career goal.

I already uploaded my resume. I did not list each client project as a separate experience. If that helps, I can update my resume to include each client project as its own role. I can make a second document and upload it in the next days.

The phrase "Zen architecture" might be confusing, and "headless architecture" might not be clear to everyone. I want to brainstorm other phrases. I lead design teams, development teams, product teams, and marketing teams. I want a clearer way to describe that from brand to product.

I like the idea of systems and the metaphor of an architect or orchestra. "Systems designer" could work because I studied design and learned to think about the whole system. The impact could be a subline.

AI should be included because it is hard to build technical products without it now. I have been coding since it came out, using Midjourney since it launched, and using ChatGPT to streamline thoughts, wireframes, and content for clients. I understand the concerns and limitations of companies that are unsure whether to hire more or fewer developers. I can bring that in.

I like the design-development connection and the product idea. I have not yet worked in food and only on the edge of transportation, so I need to be careful not to mix my experience with my political goals or ethics.
