Role Overview

We are seeking a Director of AI & Product Innovation to own the company’s AI strategy and execution across the product portfolio. This is a senior leadership role responsible for defining the AI vision, shaping multi-year roadmaps, engaging directly with customers, and driving measurable business outcomes through AI-powered capabilities.

This leader will operate at both strategic and execution levels — setting direction while staying close enough to delivery to validate architectures, guide critical design decisions, and occasionally prototype or pressure-test solutions.

Guiding MLOps and deployment patterns
Sponsor and oversee POCs and pilots, ensuring rapid path to production.
Define AI governance standards covering security, bias, hallucination risk, privacy, and compliance.
Ensure AI capabilities align with pricing models and unit economics.
Innovation & Ecosystem Leadership

Build strategic partnerships with cloud providers, AI vendors, and research institutions.
Evaluate emerging technologies for commercial viability and competitive advantage.
Champion a culture of innovation across Product and Engineering organizations.
Establish internal innovation programs and capability-building initiatives.

Proven ownership of enterprise product roadmaps and large-scale initiatives.
Strong technical foundation in AI/ML and GenAI (able to review, challenge, and guide implementations).
Demonstrated experience working directly with C-level customers and enterprise stakeholders.
Strong business acumen around AI cost models, pricing strategy, and ROI.
Exceptional executive communication and influence skills.
Deep understanding of data privacy, IP protection, and responsible AI practices.
Preferred

Success in This Role
A clearly articulated, customer-driven AI product strategy.
Tangible revenue and differentiation from AI-enabled capabilities.
Strong client adoption and positive market perception.
Highly effective partnership with Engineering and Commercial teams.
Recognition of the company as a leader in applied AI within the industry.

Working Conditions/Physical Demands:

This position is fully remote, with limited travel that may be required for occasional team meetings, training sessions, or business events. Work is performed primarily in a home-office environment using standard office equipment such as a computer, keyboard, mouse, and phone.
